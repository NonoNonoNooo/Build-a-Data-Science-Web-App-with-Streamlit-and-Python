# Build-a-Data-Science-Web-App-with-Streamlit-and-Python

# About this Managed Project

Welcome to this hands-on project on building your first data science web app with the Streamlit library in Python. By the end of this project, you are going to be comfortable with using Python and Streamlit to build beautiful and interactive web apps with zero web development experience! We are going to load, explore, visualize and interact with data, and generate dashboards in less than 100 lines of Python code!

Prior experience with writing simple Python scripts and using pandas for data manipulation is recommended.

Note: This course works best for learners who are based in the North America region. Weâ€™re currently working on providing the same experience in other regions.


# Summary

I successfully completed a practical project to create my first web application for data analysis using the Streamlit library in the Python programming language. After completing this project, I gained the skills to use Python and Streamlit to develop attractive and interactive web applications!

We worked with data: loading, exploring, visualizing, and interacting with it, as well as creating dashboards with less than 100 lines of Python code!

The project consisted of the following steps:

Project overview and demo
Turning simple Python scripts into web applications
Loading data about accidents with vehicles
Data visualization on a map
Data filtering and interactive tables
Displaying filtered data on a 3D interactive map
Continue working with the 3D interactive map
Graphs and bar graphs
Select data using drop-down lists"
